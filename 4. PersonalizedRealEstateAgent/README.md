# Personalized Real Estate Agent

## Project Overview

### Project Introduction

Imagine you are a software engineer at "Future Homes Realty," an innovative real estate company aiming to redefine the property search experience. In an increasingly competitive market where customer satisfaction hinges on personalization, the company seeks to leverage cutting-edge technology to deliver tailored, engaging experiences for each client. The goal is to create an application that transforms conventional property listings into personalized narratives that speak directly to potential buyers' unique needs and preferences.

#### The Challenge

Your task is to develop "HomeMatch," an advanced real estate application that harnesses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases. The platform will enable property descriptions to be dynamically generated and personalized based on each buyer’s input. This solution is designed to enhance property search efficiency by matching buyer preferences with real estate listings, presenting them in a more relatable and engaging manner.

#### Core Components of "HomeMatch"

- **Understanding Buyer Preferences:**
  - Buyers will provide specific requirements such as location, property type, budget, amenities, and lifestyle preferences.
  - The application will process these inputs using LLMs, enabling the system to interpret and handle natural language descriptions that go beyond simple filtering.

- **Integration with a Vector Database:**
  - The platform will be connected to a vector database to store and retrieve property listings. This database will utilize vector embeddings to represent the properties semantically, allowing for more precise matching based on buyer preferences.
  - Properties will be indexed based on various factors such as neighborhood ambiance, architectural styles, and proximity to key amenities.

- **Personalized Listing Description Generation:**
  - Once suitable listings are identified, the system will use an LLM to rewrite the property descriptions, emphasizing features most likely to appeal to the buyer. This ensures the listings are personalized without altering factual content.

- **Listing Presentation:**
  - The final output will consist of personalized property descriptions that match the buyer’s preferences, providing an enriched search experience.

### Project Instructions

#### Step 1: Setting Up the Python Application
- **Initialize the Python Environment:**
  - Set up a new Python project and create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
  - Install required packages, such as:
    - `LangChain` for integrating LLMs with the application.
    - A suitable LLM API, such as OpenAI's GPT models or Google Gemini.
    - A vector database package, such as `ChromaDB` or `LanceDB`, for managing real estate listings.

#### Step 2: Generating Real Estate Listings
- **Generate Listings Using an LLM:**
  - Create at least 10 sample property listings, each with varying details like neighborhood, price, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage. The listings should be designed to test the application’s ability to generate diverse property descriptions.
  
Example of a property listing:

```python
Neighborhood: Green Oaks  
Price: 800,000  
Bedrooms: 3  
Bathrooms: 2  
House Size: 2,000 sqft  

Description: Welcome to this eco-friendly oasis nestled in the heart of Green Oaks. This charming 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom home boasts energy-efficient features such as solar panels and a well-insulated structure. Natural light floods the living spaces, highlighting the beautiful hardwood floors and eco-conscious finishes. The open-concept kitchen and dining area lead to a spacious backyard with a vegetable garden, perfect for the eco-conscious family. Embrace sustainable living without compromising on style in this Green Oaks gem.

Neighborhood Description: Green Oaks is a close-knit, environmentally-conscious community with access to organic grocery stores, community gardens, and bike paths. Take a stroll through the nearby Green Oaks Park or grab a cup of coffee at the cozy Green Bean Cafe. With easy access to public transportation and bike lanes, commuting is a breeze.
```

- **Populate the Database:**
  - Store these generated listings in the vector database for later retrieval and testing.

#### Step 3: Storing Listings in a Vector Database
- **Vector Database Setup:**
  - Configure the vector database (ChromaDB or an alternative) to store the property listings. Each listing will be converted into vector embeddings that capture the semantic content of the listing descriptions.
  
- **Embedding Generation and Storage:**
  - Use the LLM to convert the text descriptions into embeddings that represent the meaning of each listing, then store these embeddings in the vector database for efficient querying.

#### Step 4: Building the User Preference Interface
- **Collecting Buyer Preferences:**
  - Design a user interface or input method to collect buyer preferences, which may include questions on desired features such as the number of bedrooms, amenities, location, and budget. 
  - Example questions for collecting preferences:

```python
questions = [   
    "How big do you want your house to be?", 
    "What are the three most important factors when choosing a property?", 
    "Which amenities would you like?", 
    "What transportation options are important to you?",
    "How urban do you want your neighborhood to be?",   
]

answers = [
    "A comfortable three-bedroom house with a spacious kitchen and a cozy living room.",
    "A quiet neighborhood, good local schools, and convenient shopping options.",
    "A backyard for gardening, a two-car garage, and a modern, energy-efficient heating system.",
    "Easy access to a reliable bus line, proximity to a major highway, and bike-friendly roads.",
    "A balance between suburban tranquility and access to urban amenities like restaurants and theaters."
]
```

- **Preference Parsing and Structuring:**
  - Implement logic to interpret and structure these buyer inputs into a standardized format, ready for querying the vector database.

#### Step 5: Searching Based on Preferences
- **Semantic Search Implementation:**
  - Use the buyer’s structured preferences to perform a semantic search on the vector database, identifying properties that align closely with the input preferences.
  
- **Listing Retrieval Logic:**
  - Fine-tune the search algorithm to prioritize listings based on their semantic relevance to the buyer's preferences, ensuring the most appropriate properties are returned.

#### Step 6: Personalizing Listing Descriptions
- **LLM Augmentation for Personalization:**
  - For each retrieved listing, utilize the LLM to modify the property description, emphasizing the features that align with the buyer’s stated preferences.
  - Ensure factual accuracy is maintained during the augmentation process while enhancing the appeal of the listing through personalized narratives.
